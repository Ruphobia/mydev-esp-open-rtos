# Yet another one wire driver for the ESP8266

This is a port of a bit-banging one wire driver based on the implementation
from NodeMCU.

This, in turn, appears to have been based on the PJRC Teensy driver
(https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html), by Jim Studt, Paul
Stoffregen, and a host of others.

The original code is licensed under the MIT license.  The CRC code was taken
(at least partially) from Dallas Semiconductor sample code, which was licensed
under an MIT license with an additional clause (prohibiting inappropriate use
of the Dallas Semiconductor name).  See the accompanying LICENSE file for
details.
